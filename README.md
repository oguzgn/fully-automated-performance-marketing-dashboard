#  Campaign Tracking and Analysis System

Building a successful marketing tracking system starts with creating a **systematic and detailed campaign naming structure**. This structure is critical for ensuring accuracy and ease in the analysis process.

---

## **Campaign Naming Structure**

A well-structured campaign name should include the following components:

- **Campaign Objective:** The goal of the campaign.
- **Target Region:** Geographical targeting.
- **Audience:** The audience targeted by the campaign.
- **Language:** The language of the campaign.
- **Funnel Stage:** The stage of the user journey being addressed.
- **Campaign Content:** The core message of the campaign.

This structure serves as a foundation for conducting detailed analyses on datasets such as **`marketing-db-final-table.sql`**, enabling in-depth performance evaluation.

## **UTM Configuration and Source Tracking**

When setting up campaigns, itâ€™s essential to create accurate UTM structures. This ensures we can effectively track the sources and campaigns driving users to our site. 

UTM tags allow us to:
1. Identify the source and campaign of user visits.
2. Combine this data with tools like **Google Analytics** to analyze user behavior.

## **Google Analytics and Goal Setting**

With **Google Analytics**, we can monitor user behavior on our site. By defining specific goals, we can measure key events, such as:

- **Sign-Up Completion:** Tracking the number of users who complete the registration process.
- **Source Performance:** Using UTM tags to determine which sources and campaigns perform better.

## **Collecting Data from Multiple Platforms**

We run campaigns across various ad platforms, such as **Meta Ads**, **Google Ads**, **Bing Ads**, and **LinkedIn Ads**. Each platform tracks data like ad spend, clicks, and impressions.

- **Google Analytics Integration:** Integrates seamlessly with Google Ads to pull cost, click, and impression data directly.
- **Other Platforms:** For non-Google platforms, use **REST APIs** or tools like **Supermetrics** to fetch data regularly.

## **Final Table and Dashboarding**

Campaign names act as **unique IDs**, enabling us to:

1. Match data from advertising platforms with Google Analytics campaign data.
2. Determine metrics such as how much was spent on a campaign and how many events it triggered.

### **End Result**
A **final table** with daily ad spend and performance metrics for each platform and campaign.  
This table can then be visualized in **Looker Studio**, creating dashboards for quick and effective analysis.
